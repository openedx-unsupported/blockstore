class LongLivedSignedUrlStorage(Storage):  # pylint: disable=abstract-method
    """
    Storage backend for generating longer-lived signed URLs.

    It only implements the `url` operation; all other operations (delete,
    exists, listdir, etc.) will raise NotImplementedErrors.
    This is why we disable pylint's abstract method check for this class.

    THIS CLASS IS SPECIFIC TO THE S3Boto3Storage BACKEND.
    It will not work with FileSystemStorage or any other backend.
    (If it seemed prudent, though, this class could be generalized to work
     with other storage backends.)

    Context:

        When powering Blockstore with the S3SBoto3torageBackend, asset URLs are
        exposed to clients (and users) by generating signed S3 URLs.
        The ideal time-to-live of these URLs is ~24-48 hours;
        that is, long enough such that users may interact with content without
        losing access to assets in the middle of their session,
        but short enough as to avoid granting perpetual unauthenticated access
        to copyrighted content.

        However, servers deployed on AWS are often given *temporary*
        credentials instead of permanent ones. In particular, edx.org
        does this according to the AWS IAM best practices [1], which state:
        > "Use temporary security credentials (IAM roles) instead of long-term access keys".

        If such temporary credentials are used
        to sign S3 URLs, then the S3 URLs will automatically expire when
        then the temporary credentials  expire (even if the URL was just
        signed!). Thus, temporary credentials, although preferred by some operators,
        cannot be depended upon to sign our "long-lasting" S3 URLs.

        The compromise here is to allow Blockstore to have two separate
        sets of credentials:
        1. temporary credentials that allow full read/write/delete access to S3
           (along with any other necessary AWS permissions), and
        2. permanent credentials that *only* grant read access to S3.

        The first set of credentials remain the default credentials for Blockstore,
        while the second set of credentials can be specifically used to sign
        S3 URLs. Hence, this class.
