<li><strong><strong>Blockstore stores data in Content Bundles, which</strong>&nbsp;are a local grouping of files that Blockstore knows little about.</strong><br />Blockstore doesn't understand much about the things inside of it. There is no special data structure within the core of Blockstore for Sequences vs. Units vs. anything else. OLX content, smaller assets like images, and larger assets like videos are all stored as files in Content Bundles, using conventions and groupings that make sense to the client application. A separate plugin layer will be able to listen to and take action for particular types of Content Bundles.</li>
<li><strong>Blockstore is a lower level storage abstraction that XBlocks (and other clients) build upon.</strong><br />We will compose Blockstore primitives in various ways to store content, but there isn't a 1:1 mapping of concepts. For instance, a Collection is not equivalent to a Course or a Library. A Collection might in fact store multiple Course Runs and multiple Library equivalents. A Content Bundle might be used to store a Sequence, an individual Problem, or the outline of a Course Run. The concrete primitives that Blockstore offers are versioned storage and the ability to access files in other Bundles using Links. This gives us a lot of flexibility, but requires us to be disciplined about how we use it.</li>
<li><strong>Blockstore represents author intent and grouping. It favors author-friendliness even if it makes certain bookkeeping harder.<br /></strong>A Content Bundle in Blockstore is something an author wants to edit, version, import, and export as a single thing.&nbsp;<span class="inline-comment-marker valid" data-ref="50fcff48-54fd-4262-b350-b781c699cffb" style="background-color: rgba(246, 195, 66, 0.3);">That means a Bundle can be a single problem or an entire sequence.</span>&nbsp;Things stored in Blockstore are not read-optimized, and are not the data structure that students interact with in the end. The definitions of a mostly static learning sequence and a learning sequence with an adaptive component might look completely different when stored in Blockstore, even if the Learner eventually experiences them in a similar way. The imported and exported bundle that is a Content Bundle should be as author-friendly as possible&nbsp;&ndash; assets are grouped together with where they're used, and as few Blockstore concepts as possible should leak into how the content is written.</li>
<li><strong>Versioned content is the core of Blockstore, and plugin extensibility is focused around annotating that content.<br /></strong>Things that create, transform, update, or execute content live outside Blockstore. Plugins know when content has been changed, but they don't modify content. Plugins maintain their own data and APIs. Plugin data changes can happen outside of the lifecycle of the content itself. This means that an export of the same version of a Content Bundle will always yield the same authored content, but may yield different plugin metadata (example: new tags that were added). Also, versions are meaningful, and&nbsp;not every edit of every file spawns a new version. A version is like a "commit" in that&nbsp;<span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="0840d980-d444-414d-a516-c0dd226579d8">sense.</span></li>
