"""
Basic utilities for media file storage isolation while running tests.

We generate a lot of files with Blockstore tests, and Django doesn't natively
support isolating tests from each others file writes. All tests that write data
to file storages should use either the isolate_test_storage or
isolate_class_storage decorators.

I originally tried to use dj-inmemorystore (an in-memory Storage backend), but
ran into bugs re-reading recently written data where the files would show but
the data content would read back as empty. It was also difficult to debug issues
because the files were never persisted, so I kept on printing them out to debug
test failures. In the end, it seemed easier to just have them write out to disk.

    View function that serves MEDIA files and checks the MEDIA_ROOT each time.

    The isolate_class_storage and isolate_test_storage decorators make it easier
    to keep tests from trampling over each other by constantly changing the
    MEDIA_ROOT where these files get written. However, the normal way you add
    support for reading media files in debug settings is to do something like
    this:

        urlpatterns = [
            # ... the rest of your URLconf goes here ...
        ] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

    That doesn't work for us because the URL lookup is being initialized at
    startup and the value of settings.MEDIA_ROOT is fixed at that point. So we
    make a new view that pretty much does the same thing, except that we look up
    settings.MEDIA_ROOT every time so that we can see the values updated by our
    test isolation decorators.

    It also doesn't work for us because that `static()` call just returns an
    empty list (so essentially is a no-op) unless settings.DEBUG is True. This
    is intended as a safety feature to make sure you don't turn on horribly
    inefficient in-proc file serving in a real environment, but it also means
    that the URL pattern won't be added for tests by default.
