<p>Blockstore is a system for authoring, discovering, and reusing educational content.</p>
<p>Blockstore is meant to be a lower-level service than the modulestore, and it is designed around the concept of storing small, reusable pieces of content, rather than large, fixed content structures such as courses. In other systems and academic contexts, these are often called &ldquo;learning objects,&rdquo; and Blockstore is thus a type of Learning Object Repository (LOR). For Open edX, Blockstore is designed to facilitate a much greater level of content re-use than is currently possible, enable new adaptive learning features, and enable delivery of learning content in new ways (not just large traditional courses).</p>
