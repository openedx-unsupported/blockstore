    different versions of a Bundle (e.g Bundle Av1, Bundle Av2), but we want
    some stable way of identifying and differentiating between those references.

    The indirect dependencies are a flat list. We don't try to keep track of all
    the nested dependency relations. Instead, we want the Link to answer the
    question of "If I wanted to download this entire Bundle and all the things
    it links to, what is the complete list of other BundleVersions that I have

    a new `Link` will return a new `LinkCollection` rather than modifying the
    object in place.

    There are a few critical query patterns that we have to support here:

    1. Quickly return the entire set of things that needs to be downloaded. This
    is useful when we want to do an export of some sort.

    2. Determine if there is a Link cycle. Cycles break our assumptions and will
    lead us to endlessly prompt for updates, so we have to prevent them from
    happening.
